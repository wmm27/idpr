Description: ‘idpr’ aims to integrate tools for the computational analysis of 
    intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) within R. This package is used to 
    identify known characteristics of IDPs for a sequence of interest with 
    easily reported and dynamic results. Additionally, this package includes 
    tools for IDP-based sequence analysis to be used in conjunction with other R 
    packages.
