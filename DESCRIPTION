Description: ‘idpr’ aims to integrate tools for the computational analysis of
    intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) within R. This package is used to
    identify known characteristics of IDPs for a sequence of interest with
    easily reported and dynamic results. Additionally, this package includes
    tools for IDP-based sequence analysis to be used in conjunction with other R
    packages. Described in McFadden WM & Yanowitz JL (2022). "idpr: A package
    for profiling and analyzing Intrinsically Disordered Proteins in R."
